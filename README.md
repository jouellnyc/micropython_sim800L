## Raspi Pico and SIM800L 

##  BackStory

My goal was to get a little bit more involved in Internet of Things from a cellular perspective, not spending a ton of money up front.

To that end I did some research and it appeared that the SimCom sim800l module would be a perfect fit.  I went ahead and purchased five of these modules from AliExpress, knowing that a few of them weren't going to work. Sure enough three of them did not power up, one of them had a bent SIM card holder, but two of them did power up. 

##  Upfront lesson:
Always by at least two of the items from Ali Express

##  Prerequisites

| Item | Details |
|---|---|
| Pi Pico | Anywhere Picos are sold|
|Sim800L EVB Board| [link](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804775211999.html)|
|Battery pack if mobile| 4 x 1.2V will work or a [5V battery pack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XFBN7HX/)|

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e2227dc-60cb-489f-9f6b-476d9e145e15)

The Sim800L EVB Board accepts 5V power to the VCC and does not need the odd 4.2 V like the naked 'red pcb' board. 
I'd suggest getting a board that handles power and bypassing the worry about the power to the chip.
See power reference below.

## UART Pin Configuration

| Module | Pico |
|---|---|
| SIM800L RX | GPIO 01 (PICO TX)|
| SIM800L TX | GPIO 00 (PICO RX)|
| SIM800L GND | GND|


Pretty Straight Forward in terms of connections:

```
#gsmuart.py

import machine
import time
uart = machine.UART(0, baudrate=115200, tx=machine.Pin(0), rx=machine.Pin(1))
```

## Other Pins

| Module | Wall Power |
|---|---|
| SIM800L VCC | 5V |
| SIM800L GND | GND |

5 Pins Total, RST and VDD were not needed to be connected. I used a 5V/3A wall power supply and also 4 X 1.2 V AA Enerloop batteries in a pack for the mobile setup to power the pico (with the latter I connected SIM800L VCC  to pin 39/VSYS of the Pico).

### Tips from Arduino Forum
```
You should be very careful to:

-  Disconnect VCC first
-  Connect    GND first

Otherwise, the module can use the low voltage serial pins as ground and can get destroyed instantly.
```

### Notes from Arduino Forum
```
**Blink every 1s:**The module is running but hasnâ€™t made connection to the cellular network yet.
**Blink every 2s:**The GPRS data connection you requested is active.
**Blink every 3s:**The module has made contact with the cellular network & can send/receive voice and SMS.
```

### Vendors

#### I first tried with Hologram.io.

I tried first by putting  the sim800L upto near my  window using USB power to the pico and 5V wall power for the simb00l.

I connected a few times. But only about 3 or 4 in a short window of time. Out of probably a 25 attempts over a few days.


I tried on the roof:

I tried being mobile in an open area:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc82cffb-90fe-4cbd-bbed-6da64a1ee2ee)


Really never got a consistent connect after the first few times.


Support told me it's a dice roll for now:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad40d289-8f49-4145-a4d8-88a86f9c9e24)

NOTE: There is very little in terms of how to *actually get online* with a microcontroller using a consistent step by step process. 

It's mostly anecdotes here and there that you cobble together (voila!).

### Connected 

I connected a few times. I live in NYC , in a lively connected city, so I figured connectivity would be fine... 

This was pretty cool. I actually connected:

```
>>> uart.write(b"AT+CNETSCAN\r\n"); time.sleep(5); print(uart.read())
13
b'\r\nOperator:"T-Mobile USA",MCC:310,MNC:260,Rxlev:53,Cellid:CF00,Arfcn:1709\r\n\r\nOK\r\n'

>>> uart.write(b"AT+CENG=2\r\n"); time.sleep(5); print(uart.read())
11
b'AT+CENG=2\r\r\nOK\r\n\r\n+CENG: 0,"0685,57,00,310,260,16,cf00,04,00,7d73,255"
                       \r\n+CENG: 1,"1585,34,27,310,260,7d73"
                       \r\n+CENG: 2,"1636,28,13,310,260,7d73"
                       \r\n+CENG: 3,"1637,20,49,310,260,7d73"
                       \r\n+CENG: 4,"1634,16,11,310,260,7d73"
                       \r\n+CENG: 5,"1662,41,00,,,0000"  /\----- seems to be the 'lac'
                       \r\n+CENG: 6,"1663,41,00,,,0000"
                       \r\n'
```


Given the diagnostic info, I was able to find my myself on a map after following the "Getting GPS w/Cell data" reference and converting the relevant values.

I had REPL handy: 


```
>>> int(0xCF00)
52992

>>> int(0xCF01)
52993

>>> int(0x7d73)
32115

```

So that was pretty cool.

### Victory!

After many days of trying, I got another IP address and - using my new friend claude.ai, we connected using a clever series of AT commands. Clever because the timing and usage of the CIPSEND needs to be precise - it appears to expect a Control Z and possibly a human to be 'at the keyboard':

```
def send_at(command, wait=1):
    uart.write(command + '\r\n')
    time.sleep(wait)
    response = b''
    while uart.any():
        response += uart.read()
    print(f"Sent: {command}")
    print(f"Received: {response.decode('utf-8')}")
    return response

def connect_to_google():
    send_at('AT+CIPSTART="TCP","google.com","80"', wait=5)
    send_at('AT+CIPSEND')
    request = (
        'GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n'
        'Host: google.com\r\n'
        'Connection: close\r\n'
        '\r\n'
    )
    uart.write(request)
    uart.write(b'\x1A')  # Ctrl+Z to send
    time.sleep(5)
    while uart.any():
        print(uart.read().decode('utf-8'), end='')
connect_to_google()

```

The output being:

```
37
Sent: AT+CIPSTART="TCP","google.com","80"
Received: AT+CIPSTART="TCP","google.com","80"
OK

CONNECT OK

b'AT+CIPSTART="TCP","google.com","80"\r\r\nOK\r\n\r\nCONNECT OK\r\n'
12
Sent: AT+CIPSEND
Received: AT+CIPSEND
> 
b'AT+CIPSEND\r\r\n> '
55
1
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: google.com
Connection: close


SEND OK
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: http://www.google.com/
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: object-src 'none';base-uri 'self';script-src 'nonce-tqAwNqazLDu9rWtYPLwovA' 's
```

That was pretty exciting! A full blown TCP/IP connection on a 2G Network in NYC after (edit: (I thought)) they deco'ed 2G!
...but exciting non the less...

NOTE: The HTTP AT command sequence did not work:

```
uart.write(b"AT+HTTPINIT\r\n")                ; get()
uart.write(b"AT+HTTPPARA=\"CID\",1\r\n")      ; get()
uart.write(b"AT+HTTPPARA=\"URL\",\"http://www.google.com:80/\"\r\n") ; get()
uart.write(b"AT+HTTPACTION=0\r\n")            ; get()
uart.write(b"AT+HTTPREAD\r\n")                ; get()
uart.write(b"AT+HTTPTERM\r\n")                ; get()
uart.write(b"AT+CIPSHUT\r\n")                 ; get()

```

 but now we have a way forward for connectivity! 
 



## Takeaways/ Learnings
- Keep your costs low and test out vendors before commiting. 
- At first I was not sure who to believe, really. Hologram definitely worked, but then seems to stop working.
- Hologram is a MNVO and consolidates coverage and roaming in it's SIMs, the coverage depends on the upstream provider. The SIM800L is 2G device only. It will not work with NB-IOT at all, but also know NB-IOT is not fully rolled out yet. T-Mobile's 2G network seems to have  officially shut down on April 2, 2024, but I was able to get an IP address after that date. I found that odd. Also odd that Hologram advertises 2G networks for the US.
- [TMobile 2Gg](https://www.t-mobile.com/support/coverage/t-mobile-network-evolution) has NOT sunset/decoe'd it's 2G network...yet.
- Finally, I brought my mobile setup (pico/sim800L/battery pack) to the city and was able to get an IP address and connect to the internet at 23rd Street, K-Town and up at 7th Avenue and 57th, so that says that T-Mobile still has 2G coverage in the cityâ€¦

Sure enough, connected in the city:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ac353fc-b169-4783-b931-fb7b6dc3951f)

  
## Next Steps
- Will try the sim800L with particle.io, just for fun.
- Will try with A9G Boards
- Will try with a SIMCOM SIM7000A Board
- Will try with a SIMCOM A7670E
